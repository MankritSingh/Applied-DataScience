Descriptive statistics is very well explained with its name itself.It is the statistics that defines a given set of data  
When dealing with datasets in data science,it is very important to know about the very well.Unless one has a clear idea about the data,  
getting valuable and effective results if difficult.
Descriptive Statistics is broken down into two sub topics-measures of central tendency and measures of variability (spread).
Measure of central tendecy-Mean,Median,Mode
Measure of variabiltiy-standard deviation,variance,minimum value,max value,range(Maxval-Minval),kurtosis,skewness,Karl pearsons coeffiecient.  
First lets look at various distributions
  1)symmetric:Equaly distributed on both sides of central value(perfect bell shaped)
  2)skewed:Unsymmertic shaped data.can be positive or negative
    a)positive:The data is bent towards left.Mode is greater than mean
    b)negative:The data is bent towards right.Mean is greater than mode
  
  Pearsons coeffieceint:mean-mode/std
  Pearsons 3rd coeffiecient:3mean-median/std
  Kurtosis:Kurtosis is a measure of the tailedness of a distribution. Tailedness is how often outliers occur.Kurtosis refers to the proportion of data that is heavy-   tailed or light-tailed in comparison with a normal distribution.
